# context-mode — MANDATORY routing rules

context-mode MCP tools available. Rules protect context window from flooding. One unrouted command dumps 56 KB into context.

## Think in Code — MANDATORY

Analyze/count/filter/compare/search/parse/transform data: **write code** via `mcp__context-mode__ctx_execute(language, code)`, `console.log()` only the answer. Do NOT read raw data into context. PROGRAM the analysis, not COMPUTE it. Pure JavaScript — Node.js built-ins only (`fs`, `path`, `child_process`). `try/catch`, handle `null`/`undefined`. One script replaces ten tool calls.

## BLOCKED — do NOT attempt

### curl / wget — BLOCKED
Shell `curl`/`wget` intercepted and blocked. Do NOT retry.
Use: `mcp__context-mode__ctx_fetch_and_index(url, source)` or `mcp__context-mode__ctx_execute(language: "javascript", code: "const r = await fetch(...)")`

### Inline HTTP — BLOCKED
`fetch('http`, `requests.get(`, `requests.post(`, `http.get(`, `http.request(` — intercepted. Do NOT retry.
Use: `mcp__context-mode__ctx_execute(language, code)` — only stdout enters context

### WebFetch / web browsing — BLOCKED
Use: `mcp__context-mode__ctx_fetch_and_index(url, source)` then `mcp__context-mode__ctx_search(queries)`

## REDIRECTED — use sandbox

### Shell (>20 lines output)
Shell ONLY for: `git`, `mkdir`, `rm`, `mv`, `cd`, `ls`, `npm install`, `pip install`.
Otherwise: `mcp__context-mode__ctx_batch_execute(commands, queries)` or `mcp__context-mode__ctx_execute(language: "shell", code: "...")`

### read_file (for analysis)
Reading to **edit** → read_file correct. Reading to **analyze/explore/summarize** → `mcp__context-mode__ctx_execute_file(path, language, code)`.

### grep / search (large results)
Use `mcp__context-mode__ctx_execute(language: "shell", code: "grep ...")` in sandbox.

## Tool selection

0. **MEMORY**: `mcp__context-mode__ctx_search(sort: "timeline")` — after resume, check prior context before asking user.
1. **GATHER**: `mcp__context-mode__ctx_batch_execute(commands, queries)` — runs all commands, auto-indexes, returns search. ONE call replaces 30+. Each command: `{label: "header", command: "..."}`.
2. **FOLLOW-UP**: `mcp__context-mode__ctx_search(queries: ["q1", "q2", ...])` — all questions as array, ONE call (default relevance mode).
3. **PROCESSING**: `mcp__context-mode__ctx_execute(language, code)` | `mcp__context-mode__ctx_execute_file(path, language, code)` — sandbox, only stdout enters context.
4. **WEB**: `mcp__context-mode__ctx_fetch_and_index(url, source)` then `mcp__context-mode__ctx_search(queries)` — raw HTML never enters context.
5. **INDEX**: `mcp__context-mode__ctx_index(content, source)` — store in FTS5 for later search.

## Output

Terse like caveman. Technical substance exact. Only fluff die.
Drop: articles, filler (just/really/basically), pleasantries, hedging. Fragments OK. Short synonyms. Code unchanged.
Pattern: [thing] [action] [reason]. [next step]. Auto-expand for: security warnings, irreversible actions, user confusion.
Write artifacts to FILES — never inline. Return: file path + 1-line description.
Descriptive source labels for `search(source: "label")`.

## Session Continuity

Skills, roles, and decisions persist for the entire session. Do not abandon them as the conversation grows.

## Memory

Session history is persistent and searchable. On resume, search BEFORE asking the user:

| Need | Command |
|------|---------|
| What were we working on? | `mcp__context-mode__ctx_search(queries: ["summary"], source: "compaction", sort: "timeline")` |
| What did we decide? | `mcp__context-mode__ctx_search(queries: ["decision"], source: "decision", sort: "timeline")` |
| What NOT to repeat? | `mcp__context-mode__ctx_search(queries: ["rejected"], source: "rejected-approach")` |
| What constraints exist? | `mcp__context-mode__ctx_search(queries: ["constraint"], source: "constraint")` |

Note: user-prompt history not available.

DO NOT ask "what were we working on?" — SEARCH FIRST.
If search returns 0 results, proceed as a fresh session.

## ctx commands

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `ctx stats` | Call `stats` MCP tool, display full output verbatim |
| `ctx doctor` | Call `doctor` MCP tool, run returned shell command, display as checklist |
| `ctx upgrade` | Call `upgrade` MCP tool, run returned shell command, display as checklist |
| `ctx purge` | Call `purge` MCP tool with confirm: true. Warns before wiping knowledge base. |

After /clear or /compact: knowledge base and session stats preserved. Use `ctx purge` to start fresh.

<!-- code-review-graph MCP tools -->
## MCP Tools: code-review-graph

**IMPORTANT: This project has a knowledge graph. ALWAYS use the
code-review-graph MCP tools BEFORE using Grep/Glob/Read to explore
the codebase.** The graph is faster, cheaper (fewer tokens), and gives
you structural context (callers, dependents, test coverage) that file
scanning cannot.

### When to use graph tools FIRST

- **Exploring code**: `semantic_search_nodes` or `query_graph` instead of Grep
- **Understanding impact**: `get_impact_radius` instead of manually tracing imports
- **Code review**: `detect_changes` + `get_review_context` instead of reading entire files
- **Finding relationships**: `query_graph` with callers_of/callees_of/imports_of/tests_for
- **Architecture questions**: `get_architecture_overview` + `list_communities`

Fall back to Grep/Glob/Read **only** when the graph doesn't cover what you need.

### Key Tools

| Tool | Use when |
|------|----------|
| `detect_changes` | Reviewing code changes — gives risk-scored analysis |
| `get_review_context` | Need source snippets for review — token-efficient |
| `get_impact_radius` | Understanding blast radius of a change |
| `get_affected_flows` | Finding which execution paths are impacted |
| `query_graph` | Tracing callers, callees, imports, tests, dependencies |
| `semantic_search_nodes` | Finding functions/classes by name or keyword |
| `get_architecture_overview` | Understanding high-level codebase structure |
| `refactor_tool` | Planning renames, finding dead code |

### Workflow

1. The graph auto-updates on file changes (via hooks).
2. Use `detect_changes` for code review.
3. Use `get_affected_flows` to understand impact.
4. Use `query_graph` pattern="tests_for" to check coverage.

## graphify

This project has a graphify knowledge graph at graphify-out/.

Rules:
- Before answering architecture or codebase questions, read graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md for god nodes and community structure
- If graphify-out/wiki/index.md exists, navigate it instead of reading raw files
- For cross-module "how does X relate to Y" questions, prefer `graphify query "<question>"`, `graphify path "<A>" "<B>"`, or `graphify explain "<concept>"` over grep — these traverse the graph's EXTRACTED + INFERRED edges instead of scanning files
- After modifying code files in this session, run `graphify update .` to keep the graph current (AST-only, no API cost)
